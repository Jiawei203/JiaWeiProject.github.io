                Jianyang Tongcai Experimental School is a private boarding school established in June 2001 by Sichuan Haidilao Catering Co., Ltd. Provided with the funds from Haidilao, the School is growing rapidly due to the hard work of all faculty and students, under the support of the municipal Party committee and people’s government of Jianyang City and competent education administrations at different levels. The name of Tongcai School was inspired by “Tongcai Academy”, the predecessor of Jianyang Middle School. The term “Tongcai”, literally versatile talents in Chinese, represents the mission and goals of the school that seeks to train every student to be successful with widely developed skills.</td>
